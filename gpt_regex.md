You can use the following regular expression to identify strings similar to the given format:

```
<[^>]+> ::= (?:[a-z]<[^>]+>\s*\|?\s*)+ε?\s*
```

Explanation:
- `<[^>]+>`: Matches anything within angle brackets `<...>`.
- `::=`: Matches the `::=` part literally.
- `(?:[a-z]<[^>]+>\s*\|?\s*)+`: Matches one or more occurrences of a lowercase letter followed by anything within angle brackets, optionally followed by a pipe symbol and whitespace.
- `ε?`: Matches an optional `ε` character.
- `\s*`: Matches optional whitespace characters at the end of the line.

This regex pattern should identify strings in the format you've provided.

^ adjustment to accept strings like `<A>::=a<B>|c<B>` (with no whitespaces):
```
<[^>]+>\s*::=\s*(?:[a-z]<[^>]+>\s*\|?\s*)+ε?\s*
```

You can use the following regular expression to match general tokens containing alphabet letters and commonly used symbols in English:

```
[a-zA-Z0-9_.,?!@#$%^&*()\-+=:;"'<>{}[\]\\/|`~]+
```

Explanation:

- `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`: Matches any alphabet letter (lowercase or uppercase), digit, or underscore.
- `.,?!@#$%^&*()\-+=:;"'<>{}[\]\\/|`~`: Matches commonly used symbols in English.

This regex will match any token containing one or more of these characters. You can adjust it according to your specific requirements.

^ adjustment to escape the `"` char:
```
[a-zA-Z0-9_.,?!@#$%^&*()\-+=:;\"'<>{}[\]\\/|`~]+
```
